More and more writers switch to markdown, because they can format their text during the writing process without using any format-buttons. Once they are familiar with the markdown syntax, they can write formatted text much easier and faster than with any standard HTML-editor.  Developers love markdown, because it is much cleaner and saver than HTML. And they can easily convert markdown to a lot of other document formats like HTML and others.  If you develop a theme for TYPEMILL, please take care that all elements on this page are designed properly.   Table of Contents  To create a table of contents, simply write ` in a separate line. It will be replaced with a table of contents like this automatically.     Headlines   Headlines are simply done with hash chars like this:  First Level Headline  Second Level Headline  Third Level Headline  Fourth Level Headline  Fifth Level Headline  Sixth Level Headline        Third Level Headline  A third headline is more decent and lower prioritized than a second level headline.   Fourth Level Headline  A fourth level headline is more decent and lower prioritized than a third level headline.   Fifth Level Headline  A fifth level headline is more decent and lower prioritized than a fourth level headline.   Sixth Level Headline  A sixth level headline is more decent and lower prioritized than a fifths level headline.

You can activate both features in the system settings under the section \"access rights\". If you activate one of the features, then Typemill will use session cookies on all frontend pages. Learn all the details in the following video tutorial:     Restrict Access for the Website  This feature is perfect, if you want to lock down the whole website and only grant access for authenticated users. All non-authenticated users will be redirected to the login-page. There are two main use cases for this feature:  * Launch the website later: You want to create your website first and launch it to the public later, for example if you have finished the website design or if you have polished your content. * Share website internally: You want to share your typemill website only with certain users, for example with the company stuff or only with the members of your it-unit.  You can activate the feature with a simple checkbox under \"Website Restrictions\".    Restrict Access for Pages  If you need a more fine-tuned access and if you want to restrict access only for certain pages, then you can activate the feature \"Page Restrictions\". If you activate this checkbox, then you will find two new input fields in the meta-tab of each page:  * Minimum role for access: Here you can select a miminum role that the user needs to view the page content. Be aware that the roles have a hierarchy, so if you choose the role \"author\", then the \"editor\" will also have access. * Usernames: Here you can add one or more usernames (separated with comma) that have access to this page.  If you don't choose anything of it, then the page has no restrictions and everybody can see the content.  You have some more features in the settings area:  * Cut content: Per default only the title of a restricted page is visible to the public, the content is hidden. You can change this and cut the content wherever you want with a horizontal line. * Teaser: You can add a standard text with markdown that will be displayed instead of the content or after the content is cut. * Teaser-Box: You can optionally wrap the teaser in a box.   You can also combine these features with the registration plugin and this way create a membership website with member-only content.","url":"http://localhost/typemill/welcome/manage-access"},"http://localhost/typemill/welcome/get-help":{"title":"Get Help","content":" If you need any help, then please read the documentation on typemill.net first.

","url":"http://localhost/typemill/welcome/get-help"},"http://localhost/typemill/welcome/setup-your-website":{"title":"Setup Your Website","content":" Typemill provides detailed settings, and you have access to nearly all settings in the author panel. Learn the basics in this short video:    You will find all configurations and settings under the main navigation point settings with the following sub-navigation:  * System settings * Theme settings * Plugin settings * User settings  All settings are stored in the \\settings folder of Typemill. It is not recommended to edit the settings manually, because it might crash the system if done wrong.   Developer Settings  As of version 1.4.0 you will find some advanced developer settings in the author panel under settings. See the details below.   ! Only for devs !  ! These options are for developers only. Make sure that you fully understand what happens. For example, you should never activate the error reporting on live systems because this is a security risk.  * Error Reporting: You can switch the error reporting of the slim-framework on and off here. This can be helpful for bug-analysis, but you should NEVER switch it on (or keep it active) on a productive system.  * Twig cache: You can activate the cache for the twig templates. This will speed up the page rendering a bit, but it can also produce a headace if you changed something in your theme. The best option is to clear the cache if something does not work. * Clear cache: This will clear the cache for Twig templates and delete all cache files of Typemill. If you clear the cache, then some details might not work or look strange, for example the navigation is set back to the original state. Everything will work again when the cache has been rebuild. This happens every 10 minutes. If you want to spead up the process, then refresh your browser cache with F12 on windows machines, because it will also trigger the recreation of the Typemill cache. * Image sizes: All images in the content area will be resized to 820px width. If you want to change it, then add another value in the width-field. If you additionally add a height for your images, then the images will be resized first and then cropped to the correct aspect ratio. * Proxy: If you run Typemill behind a proxy (which is a common usecase in companies), then you can activate the proxy detection. This will read the X-Forwarded-Proto, X-Forwarded-Host and X-Forwarded-Port Headers and return the html with the correct urls. Optionally you can also add a comma separated list of trusted IP-addresses.","url":"http://localhost/typemill/welcome/setup-your-website"},"http://localhost/typemill/welcome/write-content":{"title":"Write Content","content":" Typemill provides easy and intuitive authoring tools and we work hard to create a good author experience. With the interactive navigation you can create pages and structure your websites. The visual markdown editor will help you to create content in a wysiwyg mode. The publish bar gives you full control over the status of each page. Watch the following video tutorial to learn all the details.     The Navigation  You can create, structure and reorder all pages with the navigation on the left side. To structure your content, you can create new folders and files with the \"add item\" button. To reorder the pages, just drag an item and drop it wherever you want. Play around with it and you will notice, that it works pretty similar to the folder- and file-system of your laptop. And in fact, this is exactly what Typemill does in the background: It stores your content in files and folders on the server.  However, there are some limitations when you try to reorder elements. For example, you cannot move a complete folder to another folder, because this would change all the urls of the pages inside that folder, which is a nightmare for readers and search engines.   The Editor  You can create and format your content with the Markdown syntax, that is similar to the markup syntax of Wikipedia. If you are not familiar with Markdown, then please read the short Markdown-tutorial in the documentation of Typemill. You can learn Markdown in less than 10 minutes and there is no easier and faster way to format your webpage. You will love it!  Typemill provides two edit modes: The raw mode and the visual mode.  You can switch between the modes in the publish-bar at the bottom of each page. The raw mode is the most robust way to create your content, because you write raw markdown into a simple textarea. The visual mode uses blocks and transforms each content block into a html-preview immediately. This means that you can directly see and check the formatted result.  By default Typemill will use the visual mode.  * You can change the default mode in the system settings.  * You can also switch each format button on and off in the system settings.   The Publish Bar  The publish bar of Typemill is pretty intuitiv and sticks at the bottom of the screen so that you have always full control of the status of each page. Simply play around with it and you will quickly understand how it works. In short:  * The green button \"online\" indicates, that your page is published and visible for your readers. * You can depublish a page by clicking the green \"online\" button. The button will turn gray with the label \"offline\" and the page is not visible for your readers anymore. * With the green button \"Publish\" you can either publish a page that is offline or you can publish some unpublished changes on your page. * The publish-button is gray and disabled, if the page is online and if there are no unpublished changes. * All buttons will change in real time, so you can always exactly see what is going on. * To provide an easy status-overview of the whole website, Typemill marks all pages in the navigation on the left side as published (green), changed (orange) and unpublished (red).   Working with Drafts  Ever tried to revise a published article in WordPress? Yes, it works, but if you click on \"save\", then all your changes are directly live. Typemill is much more flexible here and allows you to keep your original version live while you work on a drafted version in the background. This is how Typemill handles it:   * In visual mode: Typemill stores your changes in a new draft automatically as soon as you save any content-block. * In raw mode: To store changes in a new draft, simply click on the \"save draft\"-button in the publish controller. * You can work on a draft as long as you want without changing the live version. Your changes go live if you click the button \"publish\". * In visual mode, you can also use the discard-button and go back to the published version.","url":"http://localhost/typemill/welcome/write-content"},"http://localhost/typemill/welcome/todos":{"title":"ToDos Version 2","content":"    Visual Editor  * FIXED: File is not published from tmp to media/files if you save the block.
